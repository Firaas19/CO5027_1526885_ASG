            <p>Guitars are a beautiful part of music and a wonderful example of acoustics. The beauty of guitars. A guitar is a wonderful, versatile instrument. It is capable of playing up to 6 notes at one time allowing the user to play full-bodied chords. There are two main types of guitars, the acoustic and electric.

                 <p>Acoustic guitars and electric guitars produce sound in two different ways. Acoustic guitars use a resonating chamber to amplify the sound. Electric guitars use pick-ups to transform the sound into electrical impulses, then the electrical impulses are then converted to sound by amplifiers.</p>
